### This repo is now deprecated. See [Minuet](https://github.com/andrewscwei/minuet) for its successor.

Requiem-Styles is andrewscwei's on-going pet project for experimenting with web UI styling techniques. It is a stand-alone stylesheet library that supports vanilla CSS, Sass, LESS (deprecated) and Stylus. At its current state, it is not production ready, has an ever-changing API, and lacks proper documentation. Its features are driven by internal requirements and is meant for internal use only.

Requiem-Styles is packaged with many handy mixins and functions to accomodate efficient styling. It pairs well with [Requiem](https://github.com/andrewscwei/requiem).

# Usage

$ npm install requiem-styles

# API

Documentation is available [here](http://andrewscwei.github.io/requiem-styles).
