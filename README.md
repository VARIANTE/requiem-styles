# Requiem-Styles

Requiem-Styles is VARIANTE's on-going pet project for experimenting with web UI styling techniques. It is a stand-alone stylesheet library that supports vanilla CSS, Sass, LESS and Stylus. At its current state, it is not production ready, has an ever-changing API, and lacks proper documentation. Its features are driven by internal requirements and is meant for internal use only.

Requiem-Styles is packaged with many handy mixins and functions to accomodate efficient styling. It pairs well with [Requiem](https://github.com/VARIANTE/requiem).

# API

Documentation is not available. Again this is an experimental project and is not meant for public/production use.
